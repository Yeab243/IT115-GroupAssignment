Once upon a time there was kid who lived in a city named Seattle.
The kid's name was Jason and he lived in a house next to a lake.
Jason didnt like rainy weather so he mostly stayed inside.
When he went to school he made new friends. The new friends he made didnt really like him.
After a few weeks Jason would have to deal with a bully who wanted to steal his lunch money.
Jason tried his best to defend himself and not give the bully his money but he failed.
The next day Jason was.
