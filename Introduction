Once upon a time there was kid who lived in a city named Seattle.
The kid's name was Jason and he lived in a house next to a lake.
Jason didnt like rainy weather so he mostly stayed inside.
When he went to school he made new friends. The new friends he made didnt really like him.
After a few weeks Jason would have to deal with a bully who wanted to steal his lunch money.
Jason tried his best to defend himself and not give the bully his money but he failed.
The next day Jason was not happy with what his new friend was doing so he informed his teacher.
The teacher warned the student that he will get penelaized if didn't stop what he's doing.
And after that they all lived happily ever after.
